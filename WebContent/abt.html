          <p>Expertise, knowledge, and experience. If you are tired of inexperienced incompetent staff at your current freight forwarder, then its time to change to Taurus Logistics, and deal direct with experienced freight forwarding professionals. All our key operations staff have been in the industry for a minimum of 10 years. Most even longer....</p>

          <p>We know the best way to ship your cargo, to give you the lowest TOTAL cost. If you value your shipment, don;t take the risk, call Taurus Logistics first. We speak your language, not jargon.</p>

          <p><a name="what"><strong>What makes our service better?</strong></a></p>

          <p>Customer service is our first priority. We respect and understand that your shipment is a priority. You are our customer, not a package number in an off-shore Call Centre computer. At Taurus Logistics we don;t have a voice activated computerised telephone answering system. <strong>We have real people to talk to.</strong></p>

          <p>We do of course offer full on-line web tracking, and run very efficient internal systems, but when <i>you</i> need an experienced professional, then we are only a phone call away. Professionals, not data clerks.</p>

          <p><a name="quote"><strong>Confused with other companies quotes?</strong></a><br />
          Do you have a incomprehensible shipping quote full of jargon? You just want to know the price, right? Our shipping quotes are totalled and easy to follow. We clearly state exactly what is included, and what is not. e.g taxes  duties etc. If you are unsure please feel free to call and discuss, so you are self-assured exactly what our service includes.<br />
          <strong>BEWARE</strong> of other quotes which are either to good to be true, or are many pages long full of clauses. Also always check and question the exchange rate, and , to ensure this is not negatively geared. Often with other companies this is only noted in the terms  conditions.<
